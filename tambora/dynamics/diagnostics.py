    """Boolean mask of self-bound particles via iterative unbinding.

    A particle is bound if its specific energy in the cluster's center-of-mass
    frame is negative,

        0.5 |v - v_com|^2 + phi_self < 0,

    where ``phi_self`` is the *specific* self-gravity potential of the currently
    bound set. Particles failing the test are dropped, the COM frame and
    potential are recomputed from those that remain, and the test repeats until
    the set stops shrinking.


    Parameters
    ----------
    pos : (N, 3) array
        Positions [kpc].
    vel : (N, 3) array
        Velocities [kpc / Gyr] (internal units).
    mass : (N,) array
        Masses [Msun].
    eps : float
        Softening length [kpc].
    method : str, optional
        Self-gravity solver: ``'falcON'`` (default), ``'direct'``, ``'direct_C'``.
    theta : float, optional
        falcON opening angle (ignored by the direct methods).
    max_iter : int, optional
        Maximum unbinding iterations.

    Returns
    -------
    bound : (N,) bool array
        True for bound particles.

    Notes
    -----
    The "center" velocity for the first iteration is computed 
    using the most bound particles only to avoid stripped stars
    biasing the result.
