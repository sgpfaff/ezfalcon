"""
Boundedness diagnostics as integration hooks.

``BoundednessHook`` computes the self-bound mask of a component once per fire
(via the cached ``StepState.bound_mask``) and, from it, always maintains a
memory-light transition log. 

Boolean quantities (bound fraction, counts, full mask history) are *derived* 
from that log on demand. Coordinate-dependent reductions (COM, dispersion) can't 
be derived from booleans, so they are opted into with ``track=(...)`` and stored 
per fire.

    A particle is bound if its specific energy in the component's COM frame is
    negative (i.e. bound to the component *in isolation*).

    Parameters
    ----------
    component : str
        Component to test for boundedness.
    eps : float
        Softening length [kpc].
    track : sequence of str, optional
        Coordinate reductions to store each fire. Available: ``'com'``,
        ``'com_vel'``, ``'dispersion'``. Each becomes a list attribute of the
        same name (aligned with ``self.t``).
    capture_transitions : sequence of str, optional
        Per-flip payload to attach to each event. Subset of ``('pos', 'vel')``.
    method, theta, max_iter
        Passed to the iterative unbinding solver (must match across hooks to
        share the cached ``bound_mask``).

    Attributes
    ----------
    t : list of float

    initial_mask : (n,) bool array
        Bound mask at the first fire.
    events : list of tuple
        ``(idx, time, direction, *payload)`` per flip; ``direction`` is +1
        (became bound) or -1 (became unbound). Indices are component-local.
        Prefer the ``transitions`` / ``release_time`` accessors over reading this
        directly; they take readable direction names (``'unbound'`` /
        ``'bound'``) and handle rebinding correctly.
