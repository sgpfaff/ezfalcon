    Abstract base class for integration hooks that run between integration steps.

    A hook is a callable that receives a :class:`StepState` (a live, read-only
    view of the simulation at the current step) and observes it, typically
    accumulating results on ``self`` for inspection after the run.

    Attributes
    ----------
    default_cadence : Cadence
        Cadence used if none is supplied to ``Sim.add_hook``.

        ----------
        state : StepState
            The current state of the simulation at this step.

        Two hooks with equal, non-``None`` keys are treated as duplicates.
