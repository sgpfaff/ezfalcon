    Decorator that resolves *use_cached* dynamically.

    The cache only ever holds the *all-components* self-gravity computed
    during ``run()``, so it can only satisfy requests with
    ``include_all_components=True``. The default for *use_cached* is therefore
    tied to *include_all_components*:

      - If the caller didn't pass use_cached:
          * method given                       -> use_cached = False  (compute on-the-fly)
          * method absent, include_all=True    -> use_cached = _has_run (cache if available)
          * method absent, include_all=False   -> use_cached = False  (cache can't serve it;
                                                  a method must be provided)
      - If the caller explicitly passed use_cached=True:
          * before run()                       -> error (no cache exists)
          * with method given                  -> error (conflicting intent)
          * with include_all_components=False  -> error (cache is all-components only)
      - If the caller explicitly passed use_cached=False:
          * method absent                      -> error (need a method to compute)
